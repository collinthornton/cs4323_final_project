**All files should be extracted from the zip file maintaining their folder structures (i.e. /src, /include, /build, etc)**

Compilation
From the root folder, run the "make" command to compile utilizing the pre-configured make files, like so:

$ make <PART_NAME>

where PART_NAME is:
-part1
-part2
-part3
-test_deadlock_rollback
-test_recordbook

Execute

$ make clean

to remove the build and executable files.


To execute part 1's simulation/driver file, run the following where the two integer parameters represent the number of trainers and number of couches respectively (minimum of 3 maximum of 6):

$ ./part1 3 3

To execute part 2's simulation/driver file, run the following where the two integer parameters represent the number of trainers and number of couches respectively (minimum of 3 maximum of 6):

$ ./part2 3 3

To execute part 3's simulation/driver file, run the following where the two integer parameters represent the number of trainers and number of couches respectively (minimum of 3 maximum of 6):

$ ./part3 3 3
